### Reticulate

The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. You can use Python for the following:

* Call Python from R
* Use Python with R Markdown, Shiny, and R scripts
* Source Python scripts
* Import Python modules
* Use Python interactively within an R session
* Translate between R and Pandas data frames
* Translate between R matrices and NumPy arrays
* Bind with Virtualenv
* Bind with Conda environments

### Examples

* `python-visualization-jupyter`
* `python-visualization-rmarkdown`
* `reticulate`
* `sentiment-analysis`

### Philosophy

The intent of the reticulate package is to integrate Python into R projects, and are not intended for standalone Python work. There are many IDEs available for doing data science with Python including JupyterLab, Rodeo, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code, and we strongly recommend using one of them for Python-only projects. However, if you are using reticulated Python within an R project then RStudio provides a set of tools that we think you will find extremely helpful.
